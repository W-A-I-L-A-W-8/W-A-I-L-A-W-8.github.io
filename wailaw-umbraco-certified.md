## What is an Umbraco Certified Expert

An Umbraco Certified Expert is a designer or developer who has an expanded understanding of the Umbraco platform. As a certified expert I understand the full development lifecycle of a web based application which enables me to manage advanced projects and practice UX/UI techniques specific to dynamic content-driven applications.

##### What is Umbraco

Umbraco is a fully-featured open source content management system with the flexibility to run anything from a small campaign or brochure site, right through to complex applications for Fortune 500's and some of the largest media sites in the world.

Umbraco is strongly supported by both an active and welcoming community of users around the world, and backed up by a rock-solid commercial organisation providing professional support and tooling. Umbraco can be used in its free, open-source format with the additional option of professional tools and support if required.
