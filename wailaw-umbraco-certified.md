## What is an Umbraco Certified Expert

Umbraco Certified Expert is a designer or developer who has an expanded understanding of Umbraco. This is achieved by attending multiple courses on both the fundamentals and developer specialisations. As a certified expert I understand the full development lifecycle of a web system or application which enables me to manage advanced projects and practice UX/UI techniques specific to dynamic content-driven applications.
