My name is Wai, I come from a background in web design but for the last couple years I have worked exclusively on Umbraco websites as an implementor/developer and I am currently in the process of migrating several travel related websites to the Umbraco CMS platform and responsible for improving user experience from a client and user-side, harnessing the power of Umbraco and it's features.  I am a Umbraco Certified Expert and also familiar with WordPress development and more recently, Jekyll, the static site generator which, this site is built on.

I have a great understanding of marketing web pages and deliver solutions that are measurable. I am capable of adapting to your team's workflow and design requirements. I practice the latest web standards and keep code clean and well commented. With my experience I have knowledge I love to share. My rates are competitive and I enjoy working flexibly.
