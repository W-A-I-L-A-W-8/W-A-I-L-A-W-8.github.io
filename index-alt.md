# Declutter your content heavy, travel website and increase conversions

Does your site already generate a large amount of daily traffic, yet it could **engage** your users for **longer**?

I'm [Wai Law](/about/), an independent, web design consultant with expertise in front end development, supporting the travel industry. I care about the engagement of your site and create better page experiences  for you using information research methods and testing. **Here's how I go about this:-**

### Redesign
Select key pages in your funnel and design your user's experiences with clearer sight. Make more impactful changes to your website backed up by data, research and testing. I also deal with any performance issues in the form of website speed tests. Adjustments will be made based on the research and analysis.

### Landing Pages
These are targetted pages tailored specifically for your co-marketing campaigns and customised to your brand. I can build you high-performing templates which guide your users to taking a specific action. Some of the principles used in the redesign service are used here too.

### Video for your website
Short travel promotions for your site. Video to make your pages more appealing and to offer an effective channel for promoting your products and services. Lets put together a plan of action and I will execute it. [Discover how video can help your travel business &rarr;](/video/)
