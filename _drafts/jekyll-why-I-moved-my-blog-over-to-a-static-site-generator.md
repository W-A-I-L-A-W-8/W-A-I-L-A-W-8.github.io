Jekyll is awesome! If you want faster, lighter, functional and easier maintenance, choose Jekyll. I am a big fan of simplicity and websites that function as they were planned.

This is partly the reason I chose Jekyll as the platform for my personal website.

Jekyll is a static site generator which means it digests your source files and spits them out as an entire static website. There are plenty of options available for static site generators but I personally chose it for its generous community and the documentation that is available.
