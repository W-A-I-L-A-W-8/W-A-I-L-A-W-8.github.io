Jekyll is awesome! If you want faster, lighter, functional and easier maintenance, choose Jekyll. I am a big fan of simplicity and websites that function as they were planned, usually with substance over style. ‘If it doesn’t make your site perform better then leave it out’ is my mentality. It is easy to get sucked in over small design choices. For example you could totally over-design a button with fantastic transitions and animations but if it does not make any difference to a user's experience or solve an inherent problem then you have to ask yourself if it is necessary. I personally have wasted hours doing just this. These days I am more direct with my design and I tend to approach it with a more commercial mindset, with simplicity and functionality at the forefront.

This is partly the reason I chose Jekyll as the platform for my personal website.

### Jekyll and Static Website Generators
Jekyll is a static site generator which means it digests your source files and spits them out as an entire static website. There are plenty of options available for static site generators but I personally chose it for its generous community and the documentation that is available.
