title: Jekyll - Why I moved my blog over to a Static Site Generator

As a novice you naturally gravitate towards WordPress to produce your first blog but as you grow in experience and your knowledge of the web expands you start to discover new, better and more interesting ways to get the best performance out of your website. For me this became a sort of obsession and I was constantly on the look out to make my website faster, lighter and more functional. I am a big fan of simplicity you see and websites that function as they were planned, usually with substance over style. ‘If it doesn’t make your site perform better then leave it out’ is my mentality. It is easy to get sucked in over small design choices. For example you could totally over-design a button with fantastic transitions and animations but if it does not make any difference to a user's experience or solve an inherent problem then you have to ask yourself if it is necessary. I personally have wasted hours doing just this. These days I am more direct with my design and I tend to approach it with a more commercial mindset with simplicity and functionality at the forefront.

This is partly the reason I chose Jekyll as the platform for my personal website.
