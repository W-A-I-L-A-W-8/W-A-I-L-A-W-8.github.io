# Moving over to Jekyll

Making the transition from HTMLy to Jekyll.

I wanted the development process to be pretty painless and fast so I followed Barry Clark's advice and forked his [Jekyll Now theme](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) as a starting point.

I've customised the theme to my liking and also added a few other elements.
