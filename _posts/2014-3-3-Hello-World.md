title: Three useful tools for checking the performance of your website
published: true
---

Nobody likes a slow website, make sure your website is performing.  You can test it with these three popular tools.

## Pingdom
Enter your URL and test from a number of major cities. Identifies what's making pages slow and how to make them faster.<br><br>

##Google Mobile Website Speed Testing Tool
I suppose you could argue that this is the benchmark for all page speed testing given it was created by Google. This tool focuses on mobile sites and how to make them faster and friendly.<br><br>

##GTMetrix
Perhaps the most detailed of all the tools listed here. GTmetrix gives you loads of information about your website. Their report is packed full of data about how your site loads and helps to detect issues causing your site to become slow.<br><br>

##Bonus tool
If you don't like any of the tools above, you can try this one too:
##Varvy Page Speed Tool
Varvy's mantra is all about optimisation and speed. They have developed a number of tools to help improve the performance of your site. I like it because they can process your site fast and the report is detailed, clear and concise. You get a good overview of site's speed at a glance.<br><br>
 
##To Conclude
Try all the tools above and figure out which one is most suited to your site or which one you simply prefer. I test my sites on all of them to obtain a thorough overview of all my websites.
