## Loading more than one Google font in one URL request

Loading more than one Google font in one request can help to speed up page load time and keep your code tidy.

### How is it done?
In the head of your HTML add:

  **<link href="http://fonts.googleapis.com/css?		family=Lato:300,400,400italic,600,700|Raleway:300,400,500,600,700|Crete+Round:400italic" rel="stylesheet" 		type="text/css" />**

As you can see each font is divided by the character **|**.

This is recommended good practice on all websites. It is simple to implement and will help web pages to load just that little bit quicker.
