title: A poem about SASS
published: true
---

This is a story about a thing called SASS,

A preprocessor that's powerful and stable,

It is feature rich and industry approved,

Profession grade and totally able.
***
Never before has CSS been so fashionable,

In 1999 this seemed so unfathomable.
***
So when did CSS get itâ€™s superpowers,

Variables, partials, nestings and much more,

This really is a tool you'll adore.
***
Before you get started, you can install it [here](http://sass-lang.com/install),

It's simple to do, so do not fear.
***
Now you're in, its full speed ahead,
Check out [sass-lang.com](http://sass-lang.com/documentation/file.SASS_REFERENCE.html), 
For some light reading in bed.
