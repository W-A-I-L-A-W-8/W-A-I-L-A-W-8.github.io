## Background
The owner of this business was unhappy with their previous developer and fed up with WordPress so asked me for some advice. Although I am a designer I have a pretty good knowledge of development too so I began by migrating the website to my shared server so we could take control of it.

## Relaying the foundations
We then came up with a concept to redesign the website. It was clear that the previous iteration was no use anymore and the whole experience needed a rethink.  I made a child theme from the Kale WordPress theme and began my customisation. With Bootstrap as the foundation the site immediately friendly across all devices. The owner was originally loading all article content onto a single text page using a an RTE and I discovered that the previous developer had disabled all post functionality.

## Editor Experience
From the editor-side the interface could be made easier by simply enabling posting and creating categories and tags. Now enabled, posting news, blogs, articles can be done through the post feature and adding categories.

## Client-side
For the user the page is displayed using a classic blog view, there is a post stream on the homepage and category links in the sidebar so her users can navigate around freely.  The top navigation is clear with only high-level items showing.

## Much, much better
With the improvements and added functionality the client is much happier again and can see the power of WordPress when the UI on both the client and editor sides have been developed with some thought. To make the editing experience more painless I have activated the White Label plugin and set up editor rights which cleans up the interface to allow the editor to concentrate on what they do best...writing and editing content.
