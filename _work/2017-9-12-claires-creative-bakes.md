## Background
The owner of this business is a friend of mine. Claire was unhappy with her previous developer and fed up with WordPress so asked me for some advice. I began by migrating the website to my shared server so we could take control of it.

## Redesign
We then came up with a concept to redesign the website. We made a child theme from the Kale WordPress theme and began customisation. With Bootstrap as the foundation the site is now mobile friendly. Claire was originally loading all her article content onto a single text page and her old developer had disabled all post functionality. To make it an easier process for her I enabled posting and created some categories and tags for her. She can now post news, blogs, articles using the post feature and add her categories. For display there is a stream on the homepage and category links in the sidebar so her users can navigate around freely.

## Much, much better
With the improvements and added functionality Claire is much happier again and can see the power of WordPress when developed properly. To make her editing experience more painless I have activated the White Label plugin and set up editor rights with a cleaner and clearer interface to allow her to concentrate on the editing of her content.
