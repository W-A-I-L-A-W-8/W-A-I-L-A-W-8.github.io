title: Live Holidays Travel Group, A UX/UI Exercise for all brands
published: true
---

## Background
Live Holidays consists of a number of travel brands; Cuba Direct, Travel Direct, Cuba Direct Destination Management Company, Visa Cuba and Cuba Direct US.  

## Cuba Direct
Migration project from static site to Umbraco CMS.  The problem here was that the existing design consisted to many page templates.  I was responsible for streamlining this.  The objective was to have one template per page type.  These were designed in a local environment and then migrated across to Umbraco.  Umbraco document types and views were built in Visual Studio.  At the same time we also had to research ways to improve user experience and these changes were made to the design templates and tested for results.

## Travel Direct
This was also a migration and UX project.  The same problems existed.  On this site, there was also navigation issues.  We discovered that the menu items were not clear and misunderstood by users.  There was an even bigger problem when the navigation was seen on certain mobile devices.  Sub-navigation menus items were not clickable by the user.  Working with the Digital Manager the labelling of menu items was resolved.  Bit more work was required for the navigation.  We started from scratch and redesigned each section of the menu to work across all devices.  This was straight forward enough on the static designs but applying the correct conditions in Umbraco took a bit more time.

Holiday detail pages has received a major revamp.  The main issues:

- call to actions unclear
- in-page navigation under the fold on mobile devices

## Cuba Direct Destination Management company
No current site available so a new design created.  This was an unfinished project due to all other activities and priorities.  When I left the company I passed on my design templates to my successor for updates and implementation.

## Visa Cuba
Highest converting brand.  This site was managed by a team based in Cuba.  I was asked for my input to further improve experience and conversion.

## Cuba Direct US
A new brand aimed at US travellers to Cuba.  I was responsible for all UI design and front end development.  The website was launched and a huge success instantly turning over a revenue of Â£70,000 in just four months.  We capitalised on our knowledge and experience of building the other brands and were able to design the right engagement for our users without too much complication.  Combined with a great product.  Unfortunately the project was later abandoned due to compliance issues of running a business selling to the US market from the UK.  The website is currently unavailable while the brand is pending approval from various authorities.
