# About

Born, year of the horse in a small market town in the UK, to parents from Hong Kong and grew up by the sea. My name is Wai (pronounced **way**) and my closest buddies call me **Waister**.

I am a business Grad, self-taught Web Designer, Front End Developer & Video Editor supporting the travel industries. I always enjoyed messing around with computers when I was younger. I wrote my first program on a BBC Micro. I made it display my name infinitely when an unsuspecting user touched the keyboard.

> I'm a fan of simplicity, websites that function as they were planned, with substance over style.  If it doesn't make your site perform better then leave it out. I practice research, testing and data driven design.

My Father and Uncles were all in business so having grown up around them I have adopted their commercial mindedness and I approach web design with this same mindset. My aim is to deliver high quality designs to schedule, solve your problems and allow your users to have the best possible experience online.

### For Fun
I enjoy scootering with my toddler, craft ale, coffee, tennis, whisky, pork chops and I love bread. I have walked a marathon but still yet to run one.

### My Scribbles
I have a section on this website where I write about random things and stuff I have come across on the web that have either, enlightened me, helped with a task or offered some insight or some useful knowledge. These maybe be of interest, you may even benefit for them. You can enjoy these short snippets [over here >](/blog/)
