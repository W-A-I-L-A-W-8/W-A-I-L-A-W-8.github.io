# A bit of info about myself!

### Travel Industry Web Services
I'm Wai, I specialise in travel related website design and front end development. I can help with engagement, increased conversions and improved experience through data and testing.

I'm a fan of simplicity, websites that function as they were planned, with substance over style. 'If it doesn't make your site perfom better then leave it out' I practice research, testing and data driven design.

### More Information
Born, year of the horse in a small market town in the UK, to parents from Hong Kong and grew up by the sea.

I am a business Grad, self-taught Web Designer, Front End Developer & Video Editor supporting the travel industries. I always enjoyed messing around with computers. I wrote my first program on a BBC Micro. I made it display my name infitnitely when an unsuspecting user touched the keyboard.

My Father and Uncles were all in business so having grown up around them I have adopted their commercial mindedness and I approach web design with this same mindset. My aim is to deliver high quality designs to schedule, solve client problems and allow users to have the best possible experience online.

I enjoy scootering with my toddler, craft ale, coffee, tennis, whisky, pork chops and I love bread. I have walked a marathon but still yet to run one.

I am responsible here for front end design components and reusable CMS templates in preparation for integration with Umbraco CMS.
