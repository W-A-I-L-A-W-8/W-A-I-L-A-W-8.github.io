A bit of info about myself!

I am a business Grad, self-taught Web Designer, Front End Developer & Video Editor supporting the travel industries. I enjoy scootering with my toddler, craft ale, coffee, tennis, whisky, pork chops and I love bread. I have walked a marathon but still yet to run one.

### More Information
Born, year of the horse in a small market town in the UK, to parents from Hong Kong and grew up by the sea.

I majored in business at university but always enjoyed messing around with computers. I wrote my first program on a BBC Micro we had at our school. I made it display my name infitnitely when an unsuspecting user touched the keyboard. Other things were displayed too. Around my studies I taught myself HTML and CSS, I built some very bad websites for people I knew and I suppose it took off from there.

My Father and Uncles are all business owners so having grown up around them I guess I have adopted their commercial mindedness and I approach web design with this same mindset. My aim is to deliver high quality designs to schedule, solve client problems and allow their users to have the best possible experience online.

> I have worked with Wai on a number of projects, including building a website, SEO consultancy and video production. He is quick, efficient and a pleasure to work with. On a number of occasions he came up with innovative problem-solving solutions which contributed greatly to the successful outcome of the projects. I would not hesitate in recommending his services.
