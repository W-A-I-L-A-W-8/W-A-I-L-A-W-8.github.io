## Our Services:

### Tailored Store Setup - _AUD$1995_
We can help you to successfully launch your business online, set up a theme and optimise it or seamlessly migrate your shop from another platform if required.

### Custom Design
Do you need help tweaking a template or creating a design from scratch for your beautifully, customised online store.
- [Please get in touch for a custom quote and to discuss your requirements](mailto:hello@wailaw.me).

### Custom Design including UX/UI process
Same benefits as the Custom Design package above but we also help with the user experience process to make your design as usable and as appealing to your users as possible. To do this we reach out to your users or your target audience adopting a number of methods such as questionnaires, focus group discussions, online testing and user journey maps. This will help you identify what your target audience really wants. The UI or User Interface design part is concerned with the look and feel of your store using the information gathered during the UX process. Here we seek to make your Shopify store clutter-free and functional.
